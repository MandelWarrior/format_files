# Format Files 

## Description

The meaning of this project is to help new Linux users that come from Windows with files or directorys which names have uppercase letters or spaces in it and typing and auto-completing the name of that file or directory over the time can be a little annoying in the console.

## How it works

The script acctualy loop the files and directories that are in the head directory and formats the name changing the uppercase letter with the same, but lowercase letter and the spaces with '_'.

## How to use it

Running ```sh format_files.sh``` in your linux terminal will change all the uppercase letters with lowercase letters and change the spaces between letters with underlines all the files's names that are contained in the head directory.

*Example* 

```Health App.py``` will look like ```health_app.py``` after.

I recomend to create an alias for this.
